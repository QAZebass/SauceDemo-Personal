This is my personal repository in which I write my test on the website "Saucedemo" trying to use the best practices and techniques I've learnt in this journey and for sure, I'll continue to learn.

* For the organizacion of the test, I'm using **Page Object Model**. All the functions and the logic is included there. 

* For the manipulation of static data, I use a **Fixture**. Instead of using cy.fixture(), I just import it and then pass the information within to variables to make ir more readable and of course, it uses many less lines of code.

* For the Login feature I use a **command** in order to use it for other tests. It's a good practice for repeated flows.

I basically tried to keep the code as simple as I could in order to make readable and clear for anyone who wants to read the code. The action steps were named accordingly and all the assertions (sorry, most of them) were done in the test.
