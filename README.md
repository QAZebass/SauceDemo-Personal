This is my personal repository in which I write my test on the website "Saucedemo" trying to use the best practices and techniques I've learnt in my journey towards being an automation master.

# PAGE OBJECT MODEL

Yes, I structured my code using POM. Even though Cypress discourages the use of POM, it's still a widely used practice and I'm using it here to keep the code legible and organized. I used commands, too! For the Login function.

# FIXTURE

I'm using fixtures for all the static data!
